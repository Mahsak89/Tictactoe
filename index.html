                <p>
                    Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
                    The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

                        In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first. 
                        Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.!

                        Tic Tac Toe is known by a few other names around the world. The most common of these is "Noughts and Crosses" or simply the "XO game. <br>
                        Tic-Tac-Toe is a zero-sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, the game will end in a Tie. However, if you learn how to play tic-tac-toe and master some simple strategies, then you'll be able to not only play, but to win the majority of the time.

                        An early variation of the game was played in the Roman Empire, around the 1st century B.C. It was called "terni lapilli," which means "three pebbles at a time." The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Roman ruins. Evidence of the game was also found in ancient Egyptian ruins.The first print reference to "noughts and crosses," the British name for the game, appeared in 1864.
